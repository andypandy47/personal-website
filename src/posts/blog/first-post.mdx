## Insert clickbait here

After having wrangled with different technologies over the past couple of years, like many developers before me, I've decided its time to try and compose my thoughts and the things I've learnt into some kind of consumable format.
Therefore I present to you, the **blog-of-andy**.
Built from the ground up using Next.js, this bad boy will be serving sleek, sexy and statically generated pages containing at least one blog post of **useless information** (this one). Where we go from there though is yet to be seen.

### Possible future topics include

- Game dev with godot
- Devlogs
- Revisiting an old procedural audio project for Unity
- Web based charting frameworks
- Stuff with .Net

The main purpose of this site was really just to try out Next.js and also wanted to gain some experience in deploying a site.
For this I've used AWS Amplify, mainly because I found a youtube tutorial that showed how to do it in about three minutes.

### Why Next?

Coming at it with some React experience, Next.js was an easy sell. Pages load lightning fast and lighthouse scores for performance and SEO are 90+ straight out the box.
I ended up following [this](https://dev.to/jashnm/making-mdx-blog-with-next-js-part-1-1c0j) tutorial in order to help setup using MDX which allows writing these posts in
markdown but also gives the ability to inject React components.
